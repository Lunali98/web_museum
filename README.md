üçé  [Material UI Theme](https://mui.com/customization/theming/). Handy library for react, with ready-made components that are easy to customize. Through the theme, we defined typography with the right fonts and some common colors so we could get them through a variable.

üçé  [Accordion component](https://mui.com/components/accordion/#customization) helped us to make a drop-down list of lectures. The customization section is where the styling is copied from.

üçé  [Stepper](https://mui.com/components/steppers/#customized-horizontal-stepper) made a yellow step-by-step algorithm.
